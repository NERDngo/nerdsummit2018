While the interest in building accessible sites has arisen in part from a need for some organizations to comply with federal regulations in order to satisfy funding requirements, other organizations have embraced accessibility as a way to make their message available to a broader population. This presentation will provide a quick introduction of Section 508 and the WCAG 2.0 framework with its layers of guidance. Then we will take a look at some resources and tools for evaluating accessibility. If time permits, we will wrap up with some discussion among session attendees about how successful (or not) we are at achieving our accessibility goals and what is (or is not) working for each of us. This talk will not be focused on specific code for making sites accessible, but on the means for evaluating code. However, coding tips, tricks and best practices based on personal experiences can be shared by participants during the discussion."

The teams on the Platform used design thinking and research to answer squad specific questions. We had very little guidance on our practices. Nor did we coordinate with our developers or product managers to triangulate our efforts to arrive at a conclusion all parties agreed with.<br> <br>While we used design thinking methodologies to bring teams together for project planning workshops, the teams consistently struggled to align on a shared vision.

Our relationships suffered across design, development and product management as we each pushed our own ideas of the right path forward. Design Thinking methods alone could not help us unify towards a shared vision.<br>Early in 2017, I was tapped to spin up and lead a research team to not only open a channel with our existing customers but to also shine a light on the other data sources and practices that influence each member of the tribe. Over the year, we rethought our practices to be more inclusive of the other members of the tribe with the goal of discovering and synthesizing data from both qualitative and quantitative sources together to tighten the decision and feedback loop.  <br>In this case study, I will discuss<br>-Recognize the need to defuse and reset cross-disciplinary relationships<br>-Test and implement techniques for timely communication with large, cross-disciplinary non co-located teams<br>-Rethink our approach to cross-team workshops for planning, facilitating, and debriefing<br>-Decouple from design to bring development and product management closer<br>-Discover the common desire to find, digest, and process data across the tribe"

Since then we've seen many discussions about how open-source should be supported for the long term, but rarely much action beyond a few token donations and some long Twitter threads. In this talk we'll look at an overview of what kinds of projects are out there, how sustainability works in real terms, and what techniques have worked or not worked over the years.<br>"

You call your friend and update them that the 15 min drive is now looking like at least an hour. That's just a guess, though, you really have no idea as you lack the visibility into the conditions of the bigger system that you're now a part of. You're probably annoyed too, because waiting and sitting in traffic is a waste of time and the person behind you is trying to honk their way through it! It'd be great if this 4-lane freeway were 6-lanes! Ugh!<br><br>The solution cities have historically taken to traffic problems has been to add more lanes (capacity) or more traffic signals (process). Similarities exist in software development, where in the spirit of trying to get more things done faster, often times more people are added or more process is enforced. While well intentioned, this can end up slowing things down even more. <br><br>In order to sustainably do more, faster, a solution we've found to be successful is to visualize our workflow and limit our work in progress. Traffic jams have become rare, and most importantly, value is delivered to customer's with increased predictability, along with improvements to team morale.  <br><br>In this session we'll explore: <br>* What a work unit is<br>* Techniques to visualize and organize the flow of work <br>* Why we limit work in progress<br>* Finding the right work in progress limit for a team<br>* Pull versus push<br>* Going from good to great<br>"

Finally, I started applying what I was doing professionally into our every day lives. At first, it was a failure, but only because I didn't communicate the idea well enough to her. My second attempt went a lot better, and we now have multiple kanban's near our pantry as well as a couple of calendar chalk boards. Having this in our lives, has changed the way we communicate with each other, as well as making sure we aren't over committed in our lives. We also are working on implementing the way we budget into this lifestyle. Our sprints are for 1 week, so we do our sprint planning on Sundays, as well as retrospectives. We have a daily meeting when possible, but with our boards, we update them as soon as we accomplish our tasks or chores. We even have a backlog on our weekly board to pursue dreams of things like going to Disneyland, or even as simple as finding time to clean out our vehicles. <br><br>I am so passionate about this Agile Lifestyle, that I am hoping to have my book published by March of this year! I look forward to hopefully talking about this at your event this year. "

Serverless takes this to the next logical step of having our code be running only when it needs to. <br>Understanding how this is achieved is the objective of this talk.

      "description": "GraphQL puts a ton of power in the hands of client app developers. With it, all we need to do is ask our API for exactly the data we want, and we get it back in the shape we expect. While this might seem simple on the surface, it actually requires a significant shift in thinking about how data interactions happen between the client and the server. GraphQL offers a complete (and significantly better) replacement for REST, but since it's a whole new paradigm, it can sometimes be hard to approach.<br><br>In this talk, we'll take a look at what GraphQL is and what it offers developers. We'll demystify the GraphQL concepts that trip developers up most often and talk about how we can conceptualize them more simply while focusing on how to \"think in GraphQL\". To do this we�ll dive into schemas, types, queries, mutations, and more. By the end of the talk, you�ll know what is needed for creating your own GraphQL server and how to consume it from a client.<br><br>While this talk does assume some knowledge of client and server application relationships, a general knowledge of web technologies is really all that's required to benefit from it."

      "description": "The term Gamification is a fairly recent term. It was first mentioned in 2002 and became a HUGE buzzword in 2011. Since 2011 the gamification industry has exploded into a billion dollar industry and companies many companies have realizing that gamification of operational processes can have a huge impact on productive and customer engagement; all of which impact the bottom line. Majority of the monetized work in gamification has been in sales, training, and compliance. Specifically, how to build in game elements into existing processes and building platforms built with gamification principles to increase compliance, productivity, and/or sales. Even though this topics are received the most attention as of late, gamification can be used in all areas of the business including product development and client services. Moreover, we can pair agile development processes with gamification principles and realize some amazing results. In this talk we will explore what gamification is, how it works, and how to incorporate it into an agile development proces. This talk will discuss powerful psychology motivations that we, as human beings are hardwired to respond to and how to stimulate them with game elements. Next we explore how to harass this effect to improve the agile software development process. Lastly we talk about some strategies for pairing gamification principles into your agile development process to increase team velocity, productivity, and boost morale. <br><br><br>"

However, multi-threaded software comes with its own additional set of unique bugs and pitfalls.  Because the timing between threads isn't deterministic, the interactions between threads, without taking the proper precautions, is also nondeterministic which leads to bugs that happen seemingly randomly.  This talk will introduce the core concepts of multi-threaded programming along with the most important design patterns, tricks and pitfalls that you should be aware of if you want to avoid the dreaded randomized bug.

      "description": "Handling the flow of asynchronous data streams has always been a challenging task. Callbacks offer the quick solution. Then came promises which made it easier to write and maintain code around such data streams. Reactive programming is another take on the problem. With implementations in languages like .net, java, scala, JavaScript etc, with big names like Google, Microsoft, Netflix actively supporting and maintaining implementations of the idea in these languages, the style of programming is here to stay.<br>JS community has been appreciating the ease it brings in given the asynchronous nature of the language. Angular has adopted it as a core library, React-redux uses it. It's safe to bet that the javascript implementation, RxJS if used in the right way can help in many ways."

AWS Kinesis and SQS can be used to create a universal event stream to orchestrate Lambdas into much more complex applications. Now, with AWS Step Functions we can build large distributed applications with Lambdas using visual workflows. In this session you will see how Step Functions are different from Amazon Simple Workflow, how to get started with Step Functions, and how to use them to take your Lambda-based applications to the next level. We will start with a few granular functions and stitch them up using Step Functions. As we build out the application, we'll add monitoring so that we can ensure that changes we make actually improve things rather than make them worse. You will leave the session with actionable learnings about how to use AWS Step Functions in your environment right away."
