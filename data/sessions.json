While the interest in building accessible sites has arisen in part from a need for some organizations to comply with federal regulations in order to satisfy funding requirements, other organizations have embraced accessibility as a way to make their message available to a broader population. This presentation will provide a quick introduction of Section 508 and the WCAG 2.0 framework with its layers of guidance. Then we will take a look at some resources and tools for evaluating accessibility. If time permits, we will wrap up with some discussion among session attendees about how successful (or not) we are at achieving our accessibility goals and what is (or is not) working for each of us. This talk will not be focused on specific code for making sites accessible, but on the means for evaluating code. However, coding tips, tricks and best practices based on personal experiences can be shared by participants during the discussion."

You call your friend and update them that the 15 min drive is now looking like at least an hour. That's just a guess, though, you really have no idea as you lack the visibility into the conditions of the bigger system that you're now a part of. You're probably annoyed too, because waiting and sitting in traffic is a waste of time and the person behind you is trying to honk their way through it! It'd be great if this 4-lane freeway were 6-lanes! Ugh!<br><br>The solution cities have historically taken to traffic problems has been to add more lanes (capacity) or more traffic signals (process). Similarities exist in software development, where in the spirit of trying to get more things done faster, often times more people are added or more process is enforced. While well intentioned, this can end up slowing things down even more. <br><br>In order to sustainably do more, faster, a solution we've found to be successful is to visualize our workflow and limit our work in progress. Traffic jams have become rare, and most importantly, value is delivered to customer's with increased predictability, along with improvements to team morale.  <br><br>In this session we'll explore: <br>* What a work unit is<br>* Techniques to visualize and organize the flow of work <br>* Why we limit work in progress<br>* Finding the right work in progress limit for a team<br>* Pull versus push<br>* Going from good to great<br>"

The teams on the Platform used design thinking and research to answer squad specific questions. We had very little guidance on our practices. Nor did we coordinate with our developers or product managers to triangulate our efforts to arrive at a conclusion all parties agreed with.<br> <br>While we used design thinking methodologies to bring teams together for project planning workshops, the teams consistently struggled to align on a shared vision. As deadlines approached, poorly established communication protocols broke down and misunderstandings multiplied. Our relationships suffered across design, development and product management as we each pushed our own ideas of the right path forward. Design Thinking methods alone could not help us unify towards a shared vision.<br>Early in 2017, I was tapped to spin up and lead a research team to not only open a channel with our existing customers but to also shine a light on the other data sources and practices that influence each member of the tribe. Over the year, we rethought our practices to be more inclusive of the other members of the tribe with the goal of discovering and synthesizing data from both qualitative and quantitative sources together to tighten the decision and feedback loop.  <br>In this case study, I will discuss<br>-Recognize the need to defuse and reset cross-disciplinary relationships<br>-Test and implement techniques for timely communication with large, cross-disciplinary non co-located teams<br>-Rethink our approach to cross-team workshops for planning, facilitating, and debriefing<br>-Decouple from design to bring development and product management closer<br>-Discover the common desire to find, digest, and process data across the tribe"

      "description": "GraphQL is a query-language for APIs as opposed to databases.  GraphQL allows for an API to share a common schema with a client, including type-checking and documentation.<br><br>Relay Modern is a frontend framework that consumes a GraphQL schema and allows you to declare data dependencies on your React components.  These dependencies get merged into a single request on page-load, minimizing network traffic.  Moreover, the results of the queries are stored in a client-side cache which makes navigating a single-page application remarkably fast.<br><br>The schema for the GraphQL API and client can be automatically generated from a specially-designed Postgres database (and optional API 'plugins' written in NodeJS for things like sending emails, talking to external APIs, etc).  The CRUD fields (fields are a bit like an endpoint in REST, except they're quite different) are built for all tables and relations, and the queries include pagination, filtering, ordering, and more.  <br><br>With GraphQL, Relay Modern, and Postgraphile, a modern and performant API and frontend can be constructed fairly quickly.  Moreover, it's much easier to maintain a GraphQL API than it is a REST API as you don't have to make new endpoints all of the time, and you never have multiple versions of the same API (only deprecated fields)<br><br>The maintainability and cleanliness of GraphQL, the declarative data dependencies of Relay Modern, and the API-autogeneration-introspection of Postgraphile combine to deliver an amazing developer experience that I'm excited to share with you :)"

It also requires a very clear up methodical approach to articulating the vision, business objectives, goals, how that will be broken down to actually execute and deliver on the business strategy. Often times, organizations are stick in their old ways even with all the latest tools and thinking around them. Common problems include lack of executive understanding of what it means to agile and what digital software product development actually means. Lack of trust, accountability, communications, vision and unhappy stakeholders all mean we are not delivering on the business needs. Drawing a comparison to football, we are not winning the Super Bowl, heck, we may not even be making it to the playoffs with a large disparate, disjointed and dysfunctional team. In this talk, you will learn how to apply discipline, rigor, structure, excellence and leadership to make to get your organization moving in the right direction and ultimately becoming a winning team!"

      "description": "GraphQL puts a ton of power in the hands of client app developers. With it, all we need to do is ask our API for exactly the data we want, and we get it back in the shape we expect. While this might seem simple on the surface, it actually requires a significant shift in thinking about how data interactions happen between the client and the server. GraphQL offers a complete (and significantly better) replacement for REST, but since it's a whole new paradigm, it can sometimes be hard to approach.<br><br>In this talk, we'll take a look at what GraphQL is and what it offers developers. We'll demystify the GraphQL concepts that trip developers up most often and talk about how we can conceptualize them more simply while focusing on how to \"think in GraphQL\". To do this we�ll dive into schemas, types, queries, mutations, and more. By the end of the talk, you�ll know what is needed for creating your own GraphQL server and how to consume it from a client.<br><br>While this talk does assume some knowledge of client and server application relationships, a general knowledge of web technologies is really all that's required to benefit from it."

From the environment you need to run your application, to the software you need to build it, how do you connect it all together? You need a pluggable local environment for you and your team to work in, and a common project command library that will join your software tech and workflow together. Using Docksal, this is emphatically achievable.<br><br>Docksal is your new local environment. It's intuitive service architecture and configuration scheme enables you and your team to rapidly spin up local development environments with whatever services your application needs (Varnish, Solr, Memcache, etc.) without having to actually learn how to setup something like a complex Varnish server. More importantly, the configuration is stored alongside your project, ensuring that everyone on your team is developing in identical local environments, always.<br><br>After this talk, you will have learned how Docksal can simplify and streamline your PHP development process across your entire team. You will feel relief in knowing that the skill barrier and time investment to start using Docksal is in fact very low. Perhaps also you will feel a sense of relaxation, as your journey for finding the last local environment setup you'll ever use may finally be at an end."

AWS Kinesis and SQS can be used to create a universal event stream to orchestrate Lambdas into much more complex applications. Now, with AWS Step Functions we can build large distributed applications with Lambdas using visual workflows. In this session you will see how Step Functions are different from Amazon Simple Workflow, how to get started with Step Functions, and how to use them to take your Lambda-based applications to the next level. We will start with a few granular functions and stitch them up using Step Functions. As we build out the application, we'll add monitoring so that we can ensure that changes we make actually improve things rather than make them worse. You will leave the session with actionable learnings about how to use AWS Step Functions in your environment right away."

With implementations in languages like .net, java, scala, JavaScript etc, with big names like Google, Microsoft, Netflix actively supporting and maintaining implementations of the idea in these languages, the style of programming is here to stay.<br>JS community has been appreciating the ease it brings in given the asynchronous nature of the language. Angular has adopted it as a core library, React-redux uses it. It's safe to bet that the javascript implementation, RxJS if used in the right way can help in many ways."

Because the timing between threads isn't deterministic, the interactions between threads, without taking the proper precautions, is also nondeterministic which leads to bugs that happen seemingly randomly.  This talk will introduce the core concepts of multi-threaded programming along with the most important design patterns, tricks and pitfalls that you should be aware of if you want to avoid the dreaded randomized bug.
