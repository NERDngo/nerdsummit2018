Contact: Rick Hood rick@nerd.ngo if you can help. 

We need people mainly on Saturday (March 17) morning for:

7:00am - 8:30am
Helping to setup   
(sessions do not start until 10am) 

8:30am - 9:30am 
Helping to check people in  

8:00am - 9:00am 
Checking to see if all projectors are running OK  

We need people mainly on Saturday & Sunday for:

10:00am - 4:00pm 
Running around to the rooms to see if presenters are OK  

Help presenter time slots would be: 

9:45-10:00

10:45-11:00

12:45-1:00

1:45-2:00

2:45-3:00

3:45-4:00   

So for example, to do the 1:45-2:00 slot, you would need to miss last 5 min of a 1:00 talk, and the first 5 min the 2:00 talk.
