# NERD Summit Code of Conduct
We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, operating system, programming language, or text editor.

# PURPOSE

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all sponsors, volunteers, speakers, attendees, and other participants to help us realize a safe and positive conference experience for everyone.

# EXPECTED BEHAVIOR

Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.
Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behavior and speech.
Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert conference organizers if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress.
Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you help to create NERDSummit and make it your own.
Actively encourage other participants in their learning and communication.
Try to follow the rule, "No one speaks twice before everyone speaks once."
Actively listen and stand up for others being heard.

# UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning conduct by any attendees of NERDSummit and related events. All NERDSummit venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

Harassment includes: offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

# CONSEQUENCES OF UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR

Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated whether by other attendees, organizers, venue staff, sponsors, or other patrons of NERDSummit venues.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from the conference without warning or refund.

# WHAT TO DO IF YOU WITNESS OR ARE SUBJECT TO UNACCEPTABLE BEHAVIOR

If you are subject to unacceptable behavior, notice that someone else is being subject to unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a conference organizer as soon as possible.

The NERDSummit Organizer team will be available to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, to provide escorts, or to otherwise assist those experiencing unacceptable behavior to feel safe for the duration of the conference. Any volunteer can connect you with a conference organizer. You can also come to the registration desk and ask for the organizers.
